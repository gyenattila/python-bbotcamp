# Python bootcamp

Create a virtual environment with [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution).

Use [Conda cheat sheet](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/4.6.0/_downloads/52a95608c49671267e40c689e0bc00ca/conda-cheatsheet.pdf) for terminal commands.

IDEs that great for Python Development:

- [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) (free Community version)
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) (fully free)

## Python 2 Vs. Python 3

## Why Python?

Easy to use language. High focus on readability of code. Designed for clear, logical code easy to learn. Python allowing users to apply Python to wide variety of tasks. Focuses on optimizing developer time. Great documentation.

- Searching for files and editing them
- Scraping information from website
- Reading and editing excel files
- Work with PDFs
- Automate emails and text messages
- Fill out form

Data Science and Machine Learning

- Analyze large data files
- Create visualizations
- Perform machine learning tasks
- Create and run predictive algorithms

Create Websites with web frameworks such as [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/), [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.2.x/), [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) to handle the backend of a website and user data.

Python uses **dynamic typing**, this means we can reassign variables to different data types. This makes Python very flexible in assigning data types, this is different that other languages that are static-typed.

Pros of Dynamic Typing:

Pros:

- Very easy to work with
- Faster development time

Cons:

- May result in bugs for unexpected data types
- Need to be aware of **type()**
